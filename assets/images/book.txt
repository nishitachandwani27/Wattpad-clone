A young wizard from the gutter
Living in secret and stealing to eat is a hard life, but it's all Kuro has ever known.  Fear and necessity forged him into the finest young thief in the wizard kingdoms. Nobody can hide forever, though, and a run of poor luck lands Kuro in a place where his quick hands and quiet feet count for nothing: Avalon Academy, school of magic.

Out of his depth and unable to escape, can Kuro find a place among the other misfits at the school, or will his past return to ruin the one chance he has to leave his life in the shadows?
